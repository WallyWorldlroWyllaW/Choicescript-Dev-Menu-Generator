# Choicescript-Dev-Menu-Generator
This will take a given startup.txt file and generate a file called 'devmenu.txt' containing Choicescript code that will allow you to edit every variable in your game. 

If using CSIDE, you will likely have to open this file and delete a red dot at the start of the first line.

NUMERIC INPUTS ARE 0 TO 100 BY DEFAULT; YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY CHANGE THIS AFTER GENERATION IF YOU ARE USING DIFFERENT PARAMETERS
